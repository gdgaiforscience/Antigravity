Antigravity is built on top of the Visual Studio Code editor for a familiar but accelerated user experience. The embedded agentic assistance allows users to spend more time solving research problems and less time debugging problematic code. This workshop is designed for researchers of all coding skill levels. We will walk through simple, research-grounded examples to help you fit the Antigravity framework immediately to your own projects.\nLearn how to use Antigravity to:"

    "text": "Example 8: Building a PINN Testbench with Antigravity\nThis document outlines how to use Antigravity (your agentic coding assistant) to build a robust, modular Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework from scratch.\n\n1. Defining the Core Architecture\nStart by asking Antigravity to create a modular structure. A professional PINN testbench requires separation of concerns: - data.py: Handles geometry and point sampling (Collocation, Boundary, Initial conditions). - model.py: Defines the neural network (MLP, ResNet, etc.). - solver.py: The “engine” that computes PDE residuals using automatic differentiation and manages the training loop. - utils.py: Visualization tools for 1D/2D solutions and error metrics.\nPrompt Example:\nBuild a modular PINN framework in TensorFlow for solving the Burgers' equation. I need separate files for data handling, model definition, and a solver that uses GradientTape for physics loss.\n\n\n2. Implementing Advanced Features\nOnce the basics are working, use Antigravity to implement state-of-the-art components.\n\nLinear Attention ResNet\nAsk Antigravity to implement a more complex architecture like a Linear Attention ResNet to handle global dependencies efficiently. - Layers: Multi-head or Linear Attention. - Input Projection: High-dimensional coordinate injection.\n\n\nReliability & Logging\nRequest features like File Logging, TensorBoard integration, and Model Checkpointing to ensure you never lose the best performing state.\nPrompt Example:\nUpdate the solver to support model checkpointing (save best) and TensorBoard logging. Also, add a separate evaluation script that loads a model and plots pointwise error heatmaps.\n\n\n\n3. Creating a Frontend Dashboard\nWrap the framework in a Streamlit UI to make it interactive. This allows: - Launching training runs with varying hyperparameters. - Monitoring live logs and CPU/Resource usage. - Navigating and comparing past results.\nPrompt Example:\nBuild a Streamlit dashboard that lets me launch 'train_burgers.py' in the background, monitor its logs live, and visualize the output plots from the results directory.\n\n\n4. Key Lessons from Antigravity’s Workflow\n\nIterative Refinement: Start with a simple MLP and verify with unit tests before adding Attention or Dashboards.\nEnvironment Management: Use Antigravity to set up dedicated Conda environments (conda create -n pinn ...) to avoid dependency conflicts.\nVerification: Always ask Antigravity to create a test_pinn.py to ensure the mathematical logic (derivatives) is correct early on."
