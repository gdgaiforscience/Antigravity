Google’s new code editor, [**Antigravity**](https://antigravity.google/), is an AI-assisted IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with native agentic and generative AI capabilities built into the platform to rapidly accelerate computational and data driven development and scientific research. Antigravity is built on top of the Visual Studio Code editor for a familiar but accelerated user experience. The embedded agentic assistance allows users to spend more time solving research problems and less time debugging problematic code. This workshop is designed for researchers of all coding skill levels. We will walk through simple, research-grounded examples to help you fit the Antigravity framework immediately to your own projects. 

Learn how to use Antigravity to:

* Automatically visualise and explore your datasets.
* Wrangle and clean your data “instantly”.
* Refactor code to execute efficiently on HPC environments or similar.
* Produce machine learning pipelines that immediately fit your research problems.

This workshop is part of the [GDG AI for Science](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-ai-for-science-india-presents-googles-antigravity-accelerating-research-and-scientific-pipelines) workshop series. Join the community (in [Australia](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ai-for-science-australia/), [Korea](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ai-for-science-korea/), [Japan](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ai-for-science-japan), or [India](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ai-for-science-india/)) for talks, events, collaborations and more.


## Target Audience
This workshop is aimed at anyone that writes code for scientific research including:

* Research students (undergrad, masters, PhD, etc)
* Researchers requiring computational tools
* Data Scientists and professionals supporting scientific projects

## Requirements
Before the session please download and install Antigravity for your system by following the instructions here: [https://antigravity.google/download](https://antigravity.google/download)

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic coding knowledge will be helpful.
- A motivation to experiment
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code editor will be helpful otherwise this will be a crash-course



# Welcome to Antigravity

After installation, the first time you launch Antigravity you will answer a few basic configuration steps (all options can be be left as default and changed later) then you will have to login with your Google credentials. You can also change user-accounts later if needed.
From there you will land in the VSCode IDE, and can open a Folder/Project immediately starting hacking!

We will run through a few different examples for how you can use Antigravity.


## Example 1: First prompt

You can immediately get started with a prompt in the Agent Manager sidebar or window
```bash
Your goal is to show if temperature has changed in Sydney, Australia.
```

Keep the conversation going now it has developed more context:
```bash
Your goal is to prove this using data and code
```

Make sure you have tools (like Python) installed and the correct environments are being used. Put comments into the generated artefacts to give it helpful context hints:
```bash
run the tests in conda environment oztemp
```

Keep the agent working with more complex tasks:
```bash
Please extend this to make an animated heatmap of Australia's Annual Mean Max Temperature
```

## Example 2: Working with your data
Whilst you can start from scratch to develop a complete workflow, likely you will already have some bones of a repo. Let's create a new project folder with some data and get Antigravity to work with that context:
```
mkdir demofaces
cd demofaces
curl -L -o human-face-emotions.zip\  https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/samithsachidanandan/human-face-emotions
unzip human-face-emotions.zip
```
Now give it a prompt:
```bash
Write a TensorFlow model to classify the images of facial expressions in the Data folder into 5 classes based on the sub-folder names (Angry, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise)
```

## Example 3: Updating existing code
You may have been given some code or pulled it from a paper. You need to refactor it to run on your data or a high performance computing cluster. Download the [example script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdgaiforscience/Antigravity/refs/heads/main/EXAMPLES/BIO/kmer_single.py) or navigate through the repo.

``` 
cd EXAMPLES/BIO
```
Ask about the code:
```bash
What does this code do? Can you make my code run faster on my laptop?
```

Now parallelise it! And get the methodology for running it.
```bash
Use the conda environment "bio" for any python processing
I have been given access to the NCI HPC, how do I run this on many fastq files on that machine?
```

## Example 4: Reproduce results
Antigravity has a bunch of built in tools that will work for you. In this example we will ask it to recreate a figure from a paper. You could be helpful and put the pdf or figure into a file, or make it do all the work with a prompt like:
```bash
Recreate the Fig 1 from the paper at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09840-z
```

## Example 5: Multi-agent orchestration
From the *Agent Manager* you can launch multiple agents to work on different parts of a problem concurrently. But let's hand complete control to the Agent, set it running and go and get a cup of coffee. Start new conversation in...

Prompt 1:
```bash
I want to prove or disprove the correlation between earthquakes and Lunar cycles. Write a literature review with extensive referencing on this topic.
```
Prompt 2:
```bash
Pull the required data and setup the project to to prove or disprove the correlation between earthquakes and Lunar cycles. 
```
Prompt 3:
```bash
Write the code to prove or disprove the correlation between earthquakes and Lunar cycles.
```
Prompt 4:
```bash
Write the conclusion based on the data and review about the link between Earthquakes and Lunar cycles
```

## Example 6: Targeted literature review and summary

```bash
Perform a systematic search across ArXiv, PubMed, and Semantic Scholar for 'Non-pharmacological interventions for Neuroplasticity (2023-2026)'. Extract the N-values, p-values, and effect sizes from the top 40 relevant papers. Use Python to aggregate this data into a structured CSV. Identify and highlight 'Evidence Contradictions' where two or more papers report conflicting results for the same intervention. Generate a summary identifying the 'consensus gap' and suggest three specific hypotheses for future experimental validation.
```

## Example 7: Grant writing assitance

```bash
Read the draft grant proposal in grant_v1.docx. Cross-reference all technical claims in the 'Methodology' section with existing literature using search. Identify any 'Innovation Claims' that are actually already solved in recent 2025 publications. Check the budget section against the proposed computational requirements (e.g., GPU hours for training the specified model) and flag if the requested funds are insufficient. Suggest three peer-reviewed citations that would strengthen the 'Prior Art' section.
```

# Final thoughts

* To get the best results from an agentic IDE, it can be helpful to move from instructional prompting ("do this") to architectural prompting ("build a system that functions like this"). You don't have to be the developer or the project manager, rather think of yourself as the agent orchestration engineer!

* Try using the Gemini chat interface to make your prompts more strategic, for example you can use this meta-prompt: 
```
# Role
You are a Lead Prompt Engineer specializing in Google's Antigravity IDE and it's agentic capabilities. Your goal is to write a high-fidelity, instruction-dense prompt that will force Antigravity Agents to utilize their maximum reasoning depth and agentic research tools. 
# Task
Write a well-crafted and optimal prompt for input into the Antigravity so the returned output perfectly answers the following query: 
"[INSERT QUESTION/TOPIC HERE]"
```

* Read the generated artefacts and make changes that suit your needs

* Be somewhat careful with permissions you give Antigravity. It is very powerful and it can delete things! Browse through the options and think.

* Experiment and see what works best for you - and share it with the rest of us!

* Explore using different models for different phases of your workflow, some models are better at different tasks.
