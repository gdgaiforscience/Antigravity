Google’s new code editor, **Antigravity**, is an AI-assisted IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with native agentic and generative AI capabilities built into the platform to rapidly accelerate computational and data driven development and scientific research. Antigravity is built on top of the Visual Studio Code editor for a familiar but accelerated user experience. The embedded agentic assistance allows users to spend more time solving research problems and less time debugging problematic code. This workshop is designed for researchers of all coding skill levels. We will walk through simple, research-grounded examples to help you fit the Antigravity framework immediately to your own projects. 

Learn how to use Antigravity to:

* Automatically visualise and explore your datasets.
* Wrangle and clean your data “instantly”.
* Refactor code to execute efficiently on HPC environments or similar.
* Produce machine learning pipelines that immediately fit your research problems.

## Target Audience
This workshop is aimed at anyone that writes code for scientific research including:

* Research students (undergrad, masters, PhD, etc)
* Researchers requiring computational tools
* Data Scientists and professionals supporting scientific projects

## Requirements
Before the session please download and install Antigravity for your system by following the instructions here: [https://antigravity.google/download](https://antigravity.google/download)

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic coding knoledge will be helpful.
- A motivation to experiment
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code editor would be helpful otherwise this will be a crash-course

This workshop is part of the [GDG AI for Science](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ai-for-science-australia/) workshop series. Join the community for talks, events, collaborations and more.

```bash
#| filename: "terminal"
echo "Hello, World!"
ls -la
```

## First prompt

You can immediately get started with a prompt in the Agent Manager sidebar or window
```bash
Your goal is show if temperature has changed in Sydney, Australia.
```

Keep the conversation going, now it has developed more context:
```bash
Your goal is to prove this using data and code
```

Make sure you have tools (like Python) installed and the correct environments are being used. Put comments into the generated artefacts to give it helpful context hints:
```bash
run the tests in conda environment oztemp
```

Keep the agent working with more complex tasks:
```bash
Please extend this to make animated heatmap of Australia's Annual Mean Max Temperature
```

## Working with your data
Whilst you can start from scratch to develop a complete workflow, likely you will already have some bones of a repo. Let's create a new project folder with some data and get Antigravity to work with that context:
```bash
mkdir demofaces
cd demofaces
curl -L -o human-face-emotions.zip\  https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/samithsachidanandan/human-face-emotions
unzip human-face-emotions.zip
```
Now give it a prompt:
```bash
Write a TensorFlow model to classify the images of facial expressions in the Data folder into 5 classes based on the sub-folder names (Angry, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise)
```

## Updating exisitng code
You may have been given some code or pulled it from a paper. You need to refactor it to run on your data or a high performance computing cluster

```bash
cd EXAMPLES//BIO
```
Ask about the code:
```bash
What does this code do? Can you make my code run faster on my laptop?
```

Now parallelise it! And get the methodology for running it.
```bash
Use the conda environment "bio" for any python processing
I have been given access to the NCI HPC, how do I run this on many fastq files on that machine?
```

## Reproduce other results
It has a bunch of built in tools. You could be helpful and put the pdf into the file or make it do all the work:
```bash
Recreate the Fig 1 from the paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09840-z
```



# Final thoughts

* To get the best results from an agentic IDE, it can be helpful to move from instructional prompting ("do this") to architectural prompting ("build a system that functions like this"). You don't have to be the developer or the project manager, rather think of yourself as the agent orchestration engineer!

* Be somewhat careful with permissions you give Antigravity. It is very powerful and it can delete things!

* Experiement and see what works best for you?

* Explore using different models for different phases of your workflow, some models are better at different tasks.
